# Essential Documents

## Registration document (V5C)

Every vehicle has a registration document (V5C). It shows the vehicle's make, model, engine size, colour, date of first registration, registration number and the **registered keeper's name**.

It is your legal responsibility to keep the V5C up to date. You must contact **DVLA** when

- you change your name or address
- you change your vehicle
- any vehicle details change.

## Vehicle tax

The **registered keeper** is responsible for paying vehicle tax. To tax your vehicle you need

- valid insurance
- a valid MOT certificate (if required).

You can tax online, by phone or at certain post offices.

If you want to keep a vehicle untaxed and off the road, you must make a **Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN)**. A SORN is valid until the vehicle is taxed, sold or scrapped.

## MOT test

The purpose of an MOT test is to check your vehicle is **roadworthy**. A new car needs its first MOT when it is **3 years old**. After that, an MOT certificate is valid for **1 year**.

You may take your vehicle for its MOT up to one month before the current certificate expires.

Driving without a valid MOT (when required) is illegal and may **invalidate your insurance**. The only exception is driving to a pre-arranged MOT appointment or to a garage for repairs needed for the test.

## Insurance

You **must** have at least **third-party insurance** to drive on public roads. This is the legal minimum and covers

- injury to other people
- damage to other vehicles and property.

It does **not** cover damage to your own vehicle, theft or fire.

A **cover note** is a temporary insurance document issued before you receive your full certificate. It usually lasts one month.

An **excess** is the amount you pay yourself towards any claim (e.g. £500 excess means you pay the first £500).

Driving without insurance carries an **unlimited fine**, possible disqualification and penalty points.

If you drive someone else's car, make sure **you** are insured on their policy or your own.

## Producing documents

If a police officer asks to see your documents and you don't have them with you, you must produce them at a police station within **7 days**.

---

## New drivers

If you accumulate **6 or more penalty points** within **2 years** of passing your first practical test, your licence will be **revoked**. You must then reapply as a learner and pass both the theory and practical tests again.

Completing the **Pass Plus** scheme may reduce your insurance costs.

To supervise a learner driver, you must be at least **21 years old** and have held a full licence for at least **3 years**.

## Medical conditions

You must notify DVLA if you have a medical condition that affects your ability to drive.
