# Alertness

---

## Observation

Before you carry out any manoeuvre – such as moving off, turning or changing lanes – you should

- use your mirrors to check traffic behind
- take a **lifesaver glance** over your shoulder to check your blind spot
- signal if necessary.

A **lifesaver** is a final rearward glance just before you change direction. It checks the area your mirrors cannot cover. Time it so you can still react if it's not safe.

If you can't see behind when reversing, ask someone to guide you.

## Mirrors

Check your mirrors regularly, especially

- before slowing down or stopping
- when you spot a hazard ahead – what's behind may affect your response
- before signalling or changing direction.

When following a large vehicle, stay well back. If you can't see its mirrors, the driver can't see you. Keeping back also gives you a better view of the road ahead.

---

## Blind spots

Blind spots are areas not visible in your mirrors – hidden by the car's bodywork or not covered by mirror angles. **Windscreen pillars** can also block your view, particularly at bends and junctions. Look out for motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians who may be hidden behind them.

On a motorcycle, if your shoulders obstruct the mirrors, fit mirrors with **longer stems** to improve rear visibility.

---

## Distractions

Using a hand-held mobile phone while driving is **illegal**. Even hands-free kits can distract you. The safest option is to switch your phone off before setting out. If it rings while driving, ignore it – stop in a safe place before returning the call.

You can also be distracted by

- objects hanging in the car
- adjusting music or radio
- looking at a map
- talking into a microphone.

Set your **satnav before starting** your journey. Do not adjust it while driving.

---

## Dazzle

If you're dazzled by the headlights of an oncoming vehicle, **slow down or stop** until your eyes adjust. A dirty or scratched visor can make dazzle worse.

At night, dip your headlights as soon as a vehicle overtakes you, to avoid dazzling the driver ahead.

Switch your headlights on when it first starts to get dark – so **others can see you**.

---

## Junctions and emerging

If your view at a junction is blocked by parked vehicles, stop and then **edge forward slowly** until you have a clear view. Do not cause other road users to change speed or direction.

When turning right onto a **dual carriageway**, check that the central reservation is wide enough for your vehicle. If not, treat it as one road and wait until clear in both directions.

At **unmarked crossroads** and **hump bridges**, slow down and be cautious.

Never rely on a pillion passenger's judgement – always check for yourself.

---

## Overtaking

Do not overtake when approaching

- a bend or dip in the road
- a hump bridge
- the brow of a hill.

A **curved arrow road marking** tells overtaking traffic to move back to the left.

When passing a cyclist, leave them **plenty of room** in case they wobble or swerve.

---

## Road markings

**Yellow lines painted across the road** encourage drivers to reduce speed. They are often found on the approach to a roundabout or dangerous junction.

If traffic lights have been **green for some time**, be ready to stop – they are likely to change soon.

---

## Tiredness

If you start to feel sleepy on a motorway, **leave at the next exit** or service area and stop in a safe place. Fresh air can help temporarily, but it is not a substitute for rest.

---

## Cold weather (motorcyclists)

If you become very cold while riding, you'll lose concentration. Invest in good-quality motorcycle clothing to stay warm and safe.

---

## Emergency stop

If you need to stop in an emergency on a wet road, keep **both hands on the steering wheel** to maintain control of the vehicle's direction.
