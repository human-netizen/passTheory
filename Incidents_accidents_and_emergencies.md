# Incidents, Accidents and Emergencies

---

## At the scene of an incident

The first priorities are to prevent further collisions and call the emergency services. You can warn other traffic by

- switching on your hazard warning lights
- displaying an advance warning triangle (not on motorways).

Make sure an ambulance has been called as soon as possible. Do not assume someone else has already done it.

---

## Collisions – legal requirements

If you're involved in a collision that causes damage or injury, you **must stop**. Give your name, address and vehicle registration number to anyone with reasonable grounds to ask.

If the property owner is not available, **report the incident to the police within 24 hours**. The police may also ask to see your driving licence and insurance details.

---

## First aid – DR ABC

Use the **DR ABC** procedure: **D**anger, **R**esponse, **A**irway, **B**reathing, **C**irculation.

If a casualty is unconscious, check their **airway is open** and that they're **breathing normally**. Look for chest movements, listen for breathing and feel for breath on your cheek.

If they're breathing, place them in the **recovery position** and keep checking their airway until help arrives. Do not move a casualty unless there is further danger.

---

## CPR

If a casualty is not breathing normally, begin **CPR**. Place two hands on the centre of the chest and press down hard and fast

- depth: **5 to 6 cm**
- rate: **120 presses per minute** (about twice a second).

For a small child, you may only need one hand and should not press as deep.

---

## Bleeding

If someone is bleeding heavily and nothing is embedded in the wound, **apply firm pressure** using clean material. If possible, lay the casualty down.

---

## Burns

Cool the burn with **clean, cool water** for at least **10 minutes**. Do not burst any blisters.

---

## Shock

Warning signs of shock include

- rapid pulse
- pale grey skin
- sweating
- rapid shallow breathing.

Keep the casualty warm and comfortable. **Reassure them confidently.** Do not give them anything to eat or drink.

---

## Hazard warning lights

Use them when

- your vehicle has broken down and is causing an obstruction
- you slow down suddenly on a motorway to warn traffic behind.

Do not use them as an excuse for illegal parking. Turn them off once other drivers have seen your warning.

---

## Warning triangle

Place a warning triangle at least **45 metres (147 feet)** behind your vehicle on the same side of the road. Place it further back if the scene is hidden by a bend or hill. **Do not use warning triangles on motorways.**

---

## Motorway breakdowns

Use the **hard shoulder** or an **emergency refuge area** only in a genuine emergency. Marker posts every 100 metres show an arrow pointing to the nearest emergency telephone.

Do not attempt to repair your vehicle on the hard shoulder. Do not try to retrieve objects that fall onto the carriageway – report them using an emergency telephone.

A **'help' pennant** displayed on a car on the hard shoulder means the driver is likely a disabled person unable to reach the telephone.

---

## Tunnels

Before entering a tunnel, **remove your sunglasses** and switch on **dipped headlights**.

If your vehicle breaks down in a tunnel, switch on hazard warning lights and call for help from an emergency telephone. **Variable message signs** inside tunnels warn of congestion or incidents ahead.

If your vehicle catches fire in a tunnel, **drive it out if safe** to do so. The greatest danger in a tunnel fire is smoke and suffocation.

In congested tunnels, always keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front – you may need room to manoeuvre past a breakdown.

---

## Level crossings

If your vehicle breaks down on a level crossing, **get everyone out and clear of the crossing immediately**. Then use the railway telephone to contact the signal operator. Only try to move the vehicle if there is time and the alarms are not sounding.

If warning bells start ringing while you're trying to restart the engine, **leave the vehicle immediately**.

---

## Tyre bursts and punctures

If a tyre bursts while driving, **pull up slowly** at the side of the road. Do not brake harshly.

On a motorway, pull onto the hard shoulder or emergency refuge area and call for assistance. Do not attempt the repair there.

---

## Fire risk

If you smell fuel, check where it's coming from. Never use a naked flame near a vehicle if there's a smell of fuel. Never smoke when refuelling.

At an incident, make sure all engines are switched off to reduce the risk of fire.

---

## Dashboard warning lights

If a warning light comes on while driving, **check the problem quickly and safely**. If you're unsure, get a qualified mechanic to look at it.

---

## Dangerous goods

Tankers carrying dangerous goods display a **hazard warning plate** on the side and rear. If a tanker is involved in a collision, report its hazard labelling to the emergency services.
