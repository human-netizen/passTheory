# Safety and Your Vehicle

## Tyres

Your tyres are your only contact with the road. The legal minimum tread depth is **1.6 mm** across the central three-quarters of the tyre and around its entire circumference. This applies to car and trailer tyres.

Check tyre pressures **when cold** – at least once a week. Under-inflated tyres increase fuel consumption, affect braking and make steering feel heavy. Tyres with large, deep cuts in the side wall are **illegal**.

Uneven tyre wear may indicate a fault in the braking system, suspension or wheel alignment. If your wheels are **unbalanced**, the steering will vibrate. Turning the wheel while stationary (**dry steering**) causes unnecessary tyre wear.

## Brakes

If your brake fluid level drops too low, air can enter the system and cause **brake failure**. Check it regularly.

If the **ABS warning light** stays on, have the brakes checked immediately. If the vehicle **pulls to one side** when braking, get it inspected by a mechanic as soon as possible.

If your vehicle keeps bouncing after you press and release the bodywork above a wheel, the **shock absorbers** are worn.

## Seat belts and child restraints

Seat belts must be in good condition – they are checked during the MOT. You, the **driver**, are responsible for ensuring all children under **14** wear a seat belt or suitable child restraint.

A child under **1.35 m** (4 ft 5 in) must use a correct child restraint. On an unexpected journey without one, a child on the **rear seat** may use an adult belt. A **rear-facing baby seat** must never be fitted to a seat with an **active frontal airbag** – deactivate it first.

Passengers may be exempt from wearing a seat belt only with a **medical exemption certificate**.

## Head restraints

A properly adjusted head restraint reduces the risk of **neck injury** in a collision. Make sure it is not positioned too low, or it could increase damage to your neck in a crash.

---

## Engine and fluids

Check engine oil **before a long journey**. Top up the battery with **distilled water** to just above the cell plates. Too much oil in the engine can damage **oil seals** and cause leaks.

If the **ESC (Electronic Stability Control)** light comes on while driving, it means the system has activated because your car is approaching its handling limits.

## Fuel-efficient driving

Smooth driving can reduce fuel consumption by about **15%**. Harsh braking and rapid acceleration waste the most fuel. Driving at 70 mph uses about **15% more fuel** than at 50 mph.

To save fuel:

- Accelerate gently and anticipate hazards early
- Skip intermediate gears when appropriate
- Remove roof racks when not in use
- Keep tyres correctly inflated
- Have your vehicle **serviced regularly**

## Reducing pollution

Engines produce more emissions when **cold**, so avoid short journeys where possible. Walk or cycle instead. A **catalytic converter** on the exhaust system reduces harmful gases by up to 90%.

If stationary for some time, **switch off your engine** – it is illegal to leave it running unnecessarily on a public road. Red routes in cities help traffic flow, which also reduces emissions.

---

## Planning your journey

Plan your route using a map or internet route planner. Print or write down directions. Avoid busy **rush-hour** times for an easier, less stressful journey. Always plan an **alternative route** in case of roadworks or closures.

Allow plenty of time, especially for long distances, to avoid feeling rushed.

---

## Vehicle security

When leaving your vehicle unattended:

- **Lock it** and remove the key – even for a few minutes
- Never leave the engine running
- Remove or hide **valuables** and the **vehicle registration document**
- Park in a **well-lit area** or secure car park

Etch the registration number on your windows and fit a security-coded radio to deter thieves.

## Parking restrictions

Never park on **zebra crossing zigzag lines** or in front of a property entrance. Maintain a reduced speed over **road humps** – they protect pedestrians and children in residential areas.
