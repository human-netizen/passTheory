# Vehicle Handling

---

## Overtaking

Only overtake when you are **certain** it is safe. Do not overtake near junctions, bends or the brow of a hill. At night, be especially wary – hazards are harder to see.

When overtaking at night, wait until you have **passed** the vehicle before switching to main beam, so you don't dazzle them. In a **one-way street**, you may overtake on either side.

---

## Fog lights

Use front and rear fog lights only when visibility is **seriously reduced** – below **100 metres (328 feet)**. Switch them off as soon as visibility improves.

Leaving rear fog lights on in clear conditions is dangerous – they **dazzle** following drivers and can be confused with **brake lights**. You can be prosecuted for using them unnecessarily.

---

## Driving in fog

Reduce your speed – you must be able to stop within the distance you can see. Keep well back from the vehicle in front, as they may brake without warning. The road surface is likely to be wet and slippery.

If parking in fog, try to park **off the road**. If you must park on the road, leave **parking lights (sidelights)** on and face in the direction of traffic flow.

## Night driving

Use **dipped headlights** when following or meeting other vehicles. On a motorway at night, you must always use your headlights – even if the road is well lit.

If dazzled by oncoming headlights, **slow down or stop**. Do not close your eyes, swerve or flash your headlights back.

---

## Traffic calming

**Road humps**, chicanes and narrowings slow traffic in areas with pedestrians and children. Maintain a **reduced speed throughout** the zone – do not accelerate between humps.

**Rumble devices** (raised strips across the road) alert you to hazards ahead. Yellow lines on the approach to roundabouts or villages make you aware of your speed.

## Motorway reflective studs

Different coloured studs help you identify lanes in poor visibility:

- **Red** – left-hand edge of the carriageway
- **White** – between lanes
- **Amber** – right-hand edge (central reservation)
- **Green** – between carriageway and slip roads

---

## Tram areas

Sections of road used by trams have a **different surface texture**, edged with white lane markings. Keep clear of the reserved area.

On wet roads, motorcyclists may steer around **metal drain covers** and tram rails to avoid sliding.

---

## Wet roads and fords

After driving through a **ford** or deep puddle, your brakes will be wet. Test them by driving slowly and applying light brake pressure until they dry out.

In heavy rain, stopping distances at least **double**. Watch for spray from other vehicles reducing visibility.

---

## Snow and ice

Before driving in snow, ask whether your journey is **essential**. If you must go, clean all windows and lights. Drive at a slow speed in the **highest gear** possible.

Stopping distances on ice can be **ten times** greater than on dry roads. Fitting **snow chains** to your wheels helps prevent skidding in deep snow.

---

## Wind

On motorways, be wary of sudden gusts when overtaking **high-sided vehicles**. The shelter they provide disappears suddenly as you pass, and the draught can push you off course. Keep both hands on the steering wheel.

---

## Engine braking and coasting

Use a **lower gear** to control your speed on long downhill stretches. This gives engine braking and prevents the brakes from overheating.

**Coasting** (driving in neutral or with the clutch down) reduces your control of steering and braking. The vehicle gains speed more quickly downhill. Avoid it, especially near hazards.

---

## Skid correction

To correct a **rear-wheel skid**, steer into the direction of the skid. Do not oversteer or you will cause a skid in the opposite direction.

The **condition of your tyres** directly affects stopping distance. Keep them correctly inflated and in good condition for maximum grip.
