# Attitude

---

## Consideration

Be considerate to other road users. Cyclists, horse riders and pedestrians have just as much right to use the road as you. Do not drive in a competitive way.

Horses become frightened easily. When passing them

- keep your speed down
- give them plenty of room.

If animals such as sheep are on the road, stop and switch off your engine if asked to do so.

If you're driving a slow-moving vehicle and there's a long queue behind you, pull over safely and let the traffic pass.

## Courtesy

Be patient with other road users. Not everyone obeys the rules. If a vehicle pulls out in front of you at a junction, slow down and do not get annoyed.

Only sound your horn to let others know you're there. Do not sound it through impatience. It must not be used between **11:30 pm and 7:00 am** in a built-up area.

At night, dip your lights when

- following another vehicle
- meeting another vehicle.

When queuing at night, use your parking brake and release the footbrake – this avoids dazzling drivers behind you with your brake lights.

If someone behind wants to overtake, let them. Do not block their progress, even if you're at the speed limit.

## Following distance

**Tailgating** means following too closely. It restricts your view and leaves no safety margin if the vehicle ahead stops suddenly.

Keep at least a **2-second gap** in dry conditions. On wet roads, double this to **4 seconds**.

To check: pick a fixed object ahead. When the vehicle in front passes it, say *"Only a fool breaks the two-second rule."* If you reach it before finishing, you're too close.

If someone is tailgating you, slow down gradually and increase the gap ahead of you. This is defensive driving.

## Pedestrian crossings

At a **zebra crossing**, slow down and prepare to stop if pedestrians are waiting. Never wave people across – another vehicle may be coming.

At a **pelican crossing**, flashing amber means give way to pedestrians on the crossing. If clear, you may proceed.

A **puffin crossing** uses sensors – the red light stays until pedestrians have cleared. There is no flashing amber phase. After green, the next light is steady amber.

A **toucan crossing** allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross together.

## Emergency vehicles

**Blue flashing lights** are used by police, ambulance, fire engines and bomb disposal. Pull over safely and let them pass.

A **green flashing beacon** means a doctor on an emergency call. Give way if safe – the vehicle may stop suddenly.

---

## Trams

**Diamond-shaped signs** are for tram drivers only, but know their meaning so you can anticipate tram movements.

**Cyclists** are most at risk from tram rails – narrow wheels can get stuck in the grooves, causing loss of balance. The rails are also slippery.

---

## Road positioning

In a one-way street with two lanes, move to the **right-hand lane** to turn right. Take up position in good time so others know your intention.

At **unmarked crossroads**, slow down and look both ways.

Only flash your headlights to warn of your presence – not to give way or show impatience.

---

## Large vehicles

Stay **well back** when following a large vehicle so you can see past it.

If a large vehicle signals left but steers right, it's making a wide turn. Do not pass on their left.

If a heavy lorry is overtaking you slowly, slow down and let it pass.

---

## Bus lanes

If a bus lane sign shows **no times of operation**, it operates **24 hours a day**.

---

## Single-track roads

Pull into a passing place on your left, or wait opposite one on your right. Do not drive onto the verge.

---

## Fuel safety

A loose diesel filler cap can spill fuel on the road, making it slippery – especially on bends and roundabouts. Always check your filler cap is secure after refuelling.

---

## Motorcyclists

Ride in the **middle of your lane** so drivers at junctions can see you.

On a motorcycle under 50 cc, pull in safely if traffic builds up behind you.

Young riders crash more often due to **inexperience**. The right attitude matters as much as riding skill.
