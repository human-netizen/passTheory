# Hazard Awareness

---

## Alcohol and drugs

Even a small amount of alcohol can affect your driving. It causes

- poor judgement of speed
- overconfidence
- reduced coordination and control.

The safest option is to **not drink at all** if you're going to drive. A drink-drive conviction can **invalidate your insurance**.

Some medicines can also make you drowsy. Always check the information leaflet before taking any medication, or ask your doctor or pharmacist.

**Drugs** – both recreational and prescribed – can seriously reduce your concentration. Driving with certain drugs in your body is an offence.

---

## Eyesight

If you need glasses to read a number plate at the required distance, you must wear them **whenever you drive**. If you can't find your glasses, do not drive – find another way home.

Do not wear **tinted glasses** when driving at night – they reduce the light reaching your eyes.

If your eyesight becomes too poor to meet the legal requirements, you must tell **DVLA**.

---

## Hazard warning lights

Use your hazard warning lights when

- your vehicle has broken down and is causing an obstruction
- you're on a motorway and need to warn traffic behind of a hazard ahead.

Do not use them as an excuse to park illegally.

---

## Vulnerable road users

**Children** may run out between parked cars without looking. Drive slowly in residential streets and near schools. Flashing amber lights near a school warn of a **school crossing patrol**.

**Cyclists** may swerve to avoid potholes or change direction suddenly. Give them time and room – do not follow too closely.

**Older drivers** may react more slowly to hazards or be hesitant at junctions. Be patient.

When passing **parked cars**, watch for doors opening unexpectedly.

## Junctions and restricted views

If your view at a junction is blocked by parked vehicles or buildings, stop and **edge forward slowly** until you can see clearly. Do not emerge until you're sure it's safe.

At a **stop sign**, you must stop behind the line first, then edge forward.

You can use **reflections in shop windows** to help spot approaching traffic.

Always keep **junctions clear** in queuing traffic, so vehicles can enter and emerge.

---

## Overtaking hazards

Do not overtake when approaching

- a junction
- a bend
- a dip in the road.

On **three-lane two-way roads**, be extra cautious – traffic from both directions can use the middle lane to overtake.

If a vehicle ahead has a right indicator on and you're unsure whether they've forgotten it, **stay behind** – they may turn suddenly.

---

## Bridges

At a low or narrow bridge, large vehicles such as buses and lorries may need to move to the **centre of the road** to pass through. Be ready to stop and give way.

---

## Buses

Give way to buses signalling to pull out from bus stops when safe to do so.

Be cautious passing a stationary bus – pedestrians may cross the road in front of it.

**School buses** may stop at unexpected places. Watch for children getting on or off.

---

## Level crossings

If the red lights start flashing, **stop before the barrier**. Never zigzag around half-barriers. An amber light usually precedes the red lights.

---

## Traffic lights

If traffic lights have been **green for some time**, be ready to stop – they are likely to change soon.

If the lights have **failed**, treat the junction as an unmarked crossroads and be prepared to stop for any traffic.

---

## Road surface and weather

On very hot days, the road surface can become **soft**, reducing grip when braking or cornering.

When following a lorry in rain on a motorway, stay well back – **spray** from its tyres can severely reduce your vision.

---

## Slow-moving vehicles

An **amber flashing beacon** on a vehicle means it is slow-moving or stationary. This includes tractors, disabled persons' vehicles and works vehicles.

A works vehicle showing an arrow sign on a motorway means **pass on the side the arrow points to** – usually the left.

**Reflective markers** are fitted to vehicles over 13 metres long, heavy goods vehicles and road skips.

---

## Staying calm

If another driver's behaviour upsets you, **stop and take a break**. Do not react aggressively. Anyone can make a mistake.

---

## Tiredness

Plan rest stops on long journeys. Take a break of at least **15 minutes every 2 hours**.

If you feel drowsy on a motorway, open a window for fresh air and **leave at the next exit** or service area. Never stop on the hard shoulder to rest.

---

## Traffic calming

In areas with road humps, chicanes or narrowings, drive at a **reduced speed**. Do not speed up until you've passed through the traffic-calmed zone.

**Place names painted on the road** help you get into the correct lane in good time at busy junctions.

---

## Convex mirrors

Vehicle mirrors are often slightly curved (convex) to give a **wider field of vision**. However, they won't show everything – always check your blind spot before moving off.
