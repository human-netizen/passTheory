# Rules of the Road

## Speed limits

The **national speed limit** for cars and motorcycles is **60 mph** on single carriageways and **70 mph** on dual carriageways and motorways. These limits are reduced when towing a trailer.

In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, **street lights** generally indicate a **30 mph** limit unless signs state otherwise. In Wales, street lights indicate **20 mph**.

The speed limit is the absolute maximum – not a target. Always drive at a speed appropriate for the conditions.

## Lane discipline

On a **two-lane dual carriageway**, use the left lane for normal driving. The right lane is for **overtaking or turning right** only. Move back to the left as soon as it's safe.

On a **three-lane dual carriageway**, the right-hand lane must not be used when towing a trailer, unless directed (e.g. at roadworks).

In a **one-way street**, you may overtake on either the right or the left. Use the most suitable lane for your destination.

## Junctions and roundabouts

At an **unmarked crossroads**, no one has priority. Slow down, look both ways and proceed only when safe.

When turning right at a crossroads where an oncoming driver is also turning right, it's generally safer to turn **behind** the oncoming vehicle (offside to offside). This gives you a clear view of approaching traffic.

When **going straight ahead at a roundabout**, do not signal on approach. Signal left just after passing the exit before the one you're taking. **Long vehicles** may straddle lanes at roundabouts – stay well back.

---

## Box junctions

**Yellow box junctions** keep junctions clear. Do not enter unless your exit is clear. The only exception: you may wait inside the box if you want to **turn right** and your exit is clear, but oncoming traffic prevents you from completing the turn.

## Pedestrian crossings

At a **zebra crossing**, be ready to slow down or stop if a pedestrian is waiting. Never wave them across.

At a **pelican crossing**, flashing amber means give way to pedestrians still on the crossing. A **toucan crossing** allows both pedestrians and cyclists to cross together – there is no flashing amber phase.

---

## Traffic signals and authority

You must stop when signalled by a **police officer**, traffic officer, traffic warden or school crossing patrol. You must also stop at a red traffic light and at a junction with a **stop sign** – even temporary ones at roadworks.

At a **level crossing**, if the lights keep flashing after a train has passed, **carry on waiting** – another train may be coming.

---

## Parking rules

Do not park within **10 metres (32 feet)** of a junction. Never park on **zigzag lines**, at a bus stop, or in a disabled bay unless you hold a **Blue Badge**.

On a **clearway**, you must not stop at any time. On an **urban clearway**, you may only stop to pick up or set down passengers during restricted times.

When parking at night on a road with a speed limit **over 30 mph**, leave **parking lights** on. You may only park on the right-hand side at night in a **one-way street**.

---

## Obstructions and overtaking

If there's an obstruction on **your side** of the road, give way to oncoming traffic.

Never overtake if you're unsure it's safe – it's better to wait. When approaching a road with **parked vehicles**, keep your speed down. Children may run out from between them.

---

## Wrong lane

If you find yourself in the wrong lane approaching a junction, **stay in that lane**. Do not cut across or force your way into another lane. Continue and find a safe place to turn around.

---

## Cycle lanes

A cycle lane marked by a **broken white line** means you should not drive in it unless unavoidable. A **solid white line** means you must not enter during its hours of operation.

---

## Signals

Use your **direction indicators** in good time. Brake lights also act as a signal to traffic behind. Only flash your headlights to warn others of your presence – not to give way.

---

## Motorcycle-specific rules

**Check your left shoulder** before turning left in slow traffic – cyclists may be filtering past. Motorcyclists must not use **tram lanes**.

When going abroad and riding on the right, fit **headlight deflectors** to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers. The minimum engine size to **tow a trailer** on a motorcycle is **125 cc**.

On a dual carriageway, use **mirrors and shoulder checks** before changing lanes to cover blind spots.
