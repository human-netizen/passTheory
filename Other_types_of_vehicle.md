# Other Types of Vehicle

## Following large vehicles

When following a lorry, bus or other large vehicle, stay **well back**. This gives you a better view of the road ahead and lets the driver see you in their mirrors.

In wet weather, large vehicles throw up **spray** that can severely reduce your vision. Drop back further until you can see clearly.

If a car moves into the safe gap you've left, stay calm and **drop back again** to restore your following distance.

## Large vehicles turning

Long vehicles need much more room to turn. They may swing out in the **opposite direction** before turning – for example, moving to the right before turning left. This is to stop the rear wheels mounting the kerb.

If a long vehicle signals left but positions to the right

- **keep well back**
- do not try to pass on the left
- wait for the turn to finish before proceeding.

This applies at junctions, crossroads and mini-roundabouts.

## Overtaking large vehicles

It takes **longer** to overtake a large vehicle than a car. Before overtaking, keep well back to get a good view of the road ahead. Only overtake when you're certain it's safe to complete the manoeuvre.

Watch for oncoming traffic, junctions, bends, dips and signs that prohibit overtaking.

A large vehicle waiting to turn left at a junction could **hide another vehicle** emerging from the same junction. Wait until it has finished turning.

When waiting to turn right out of a minor road and a lorry is approaching from the right, **wait** – anything overtaking the lorry will be hidden from your view.

## Buses

If a bus signals to pull away from a bus stop, **give way** if it's safe to do so.

When passing a stationary bus, watch carefully for pedestrians – they may cross the road from behind the bus without looking. Look at the queue to judge whether the bus is about to move off.

## Trams

Trams run on rails and **cannot steer to avoid you**. They move quickly and quietly, so you may not hear them coming. Take extra care on roads where trams operate.

Tram rails can be very **slippery**, especially when wet.

---

## Side wind

**Cars** are least likely to be affected by side wind, but gusts can still catch you by surprise. This is most likely

- after overtaking a large vehicle
- when passing gaps between hedges or buildings
- on exposed sections of road.

In windy weather, give **extra room** when overtaking cyclists and motorcyclists – they can be blown off course into your path.

## Towing a caravan or trailer

When towing, fit **extended-arm side mirrors** so you can see clearly behind and down both sides of the caravan or trailer.

---

## Spray and visibility

In heavy traffic on a wet road, use **dipped headlights** so others can see you. If visibility drops below 100 metres, you may use rear fog lights – but switch them off when visibility improves.
