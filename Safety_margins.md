# Safety Margins

## Stopping distances

Your overall stopping distance is made up of **thinking distance** + **braking distance**. At 50 mph, the typical braking distance alone is **38 metres (125 feet)**.

In **wet conditions**, stopping distances at least **double**. On **icy roads**, they can increase by up to **ten times**. Always adjust your following distance to suit the conditions.

Use the **two-second rule**: pick a fixed object ahead. When the vehicle in front passes it, say *"Only a fool breaks the two-second rule."* If you reach it before finishing, you're too close. Double this to **four seconds** on wet roads.

## Wet weather

On wet roads, your tyres can lose grip. If the steering suddenly feels **very light**, your tyres may be aquaplaning – riding on top of the water. Ease off the accelerator smoothly. Do not brake or steer sharply until grip returns.

After driving through **flood water**, test your brakes. Ride slowly while gently applying the brakes to dry them out. Never drive into deep flood water – unseen hazards and strong currents are dangerous.

## Fog

Use **dipped headlights** in fog – they help others see you. Only use **fog lights** when visibility is below **100 metres (328 feet)**. You **must** switch them off when visibility improves, or they can dazzle other drivers and obscure your brake lights.

Keep well back from the vehicle in front – they may brake suddenly. Allow more time for your journey and consider whether travel is essential.

## Ice and snow

Before setting out in snow, consider whether your journey is **essential**. Clear all windows, lights, mirrors and number plates of ice and snow.

On icy roads:

- Drive slowly in the **highest gear** possible to reduce wheelspin
- Brake **gently** and well in advance
- Listen for reduced tyre noise – a sign of ice
- Allow up to **ten times** the normal stopping distance

To move off on snow, use a **higher gear than normal** to reduce wheel spin.

## Windy conditions

Strong **side winds** are most dangerous on open, exposed stretches of road. Be especially careful when:

- Overtaking **high-sided vehicles** – you may suddenly lose their shelter
- Passing **cyclists and motorcyclists** – gusts can blow them off course
- Crossing **bridges** or gaps in hedges

Give extra room when overtaking two-wheeled road users on a windy day.

## Skidding

The main cause of skidding is the **driver** – through harsh braking, sudden acceleration or sharp steering. To correct a rear-wheel skid, **steer into it** (steer in the direction the rear is sliding).

On a motorcycle, heavy braking, swerving and leaning too far can all cause a skid. If the rear wheel skids under acceleration, **ease off the throttle** smoothly.

---

## Hills and engine braking

Going downhill, select a **low gear** before the slope to use engine braking. This prevents the brakes from overheating (brake fade). Avoid **coasting** (travelling in neutral or with the clutch down) – it reduces your control of the vehicle.

When parking **facing downhill**, turn the steering wheel **towards the kerb**. Apply the handbrake firmly.

## Contraflow systems

In a contraflow, you travel close to oncoming traffic in narrow lanes. Get into the **correct lane in good time**, obey temporary speed limits and keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

## Motorcycle-specific tips

Carrying a **passenger** increases your stopping distance due to the extra weight – allow a bigger gap. In heavy rain, avoid **painted road markings** – they can be very slippery.

Wear **reflective clothing** at night and keep your visor or goggles clean. In extreme cold, wear suitable warm clothing – cold affects concentration.

Use **dipped headlights** in the daytime to help other road users see you. This is a key part of defensive riding.
